<h1>THETA (θ)</h1>

Textual Hybrid Embedding–based Topic Analysis  

</div>

## Overview

THETA (θ) is an open-source, research-oriented platform for LLM-enhanced topic analysis in social science. It combines:

- Domain-adaptive document embeddings from a unified base model (e.g., Qwen-3)
  - Zero-shot embedding (no training), or
  - LoRA adapters (lightweight, modular domain fine-tuning)
- Generative topic models
  - ETM (Embedded Topic Model) for coherent and interpretable topics
  - DETM (Dynamic ETM) for topic evolution over time
- Scientific validation via intrinsic metrics (coherence/perplexity) and downstream tasks
- Agent-based orchestration to make the workflow accessible to non-technical researchers

THETA aims to move topic modeling from “clustering with pretty plots” to a reproducible, validated scientific workflow.

---

## Key Features

- Hybrid embedding topic analysis (Zero-shot / LoRA)
- LoRA “expert adapters” for multiple domains (plug-and-play)
- Generative topic modeling with ETM/DETM for interpretability and stability
- Fine-grained, domain-aware data governance (privacy mask normalization, emoji-to-text translation, metadata stripping)
- Validation layer with coherence/perplexity and downstream task metrics (F1/AUC)
- Agent-based interactive platform (Data Steward → Modeling Analyst → Domain Expert → Interpretive Report)

---

## Method Summary

THETA follows a six-layer pipeline:

1. Data source & governance: ingestion, de-identification, noise removal, dataset-specific cleaning rules
2. Semantic enhancement: base model embedding (zero-shot or LoRA) to obtain domain-adaptive vectors
3. Deep structure mining: ETM/DETM as the main topic backbone (optional UMAP/HDBSCAN for baseline exploration)
4. Validation: intrinsic metrics + downstream tasks
5. Agent platform: orchestration, parameter tuning, report generation
6. Interpretive report: topic maps, hierarchies, trend narratives

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- CUDA is optional but recommended for LoRA training and large-scale embedding
- Typical dependencies: PyTorch, Transformers, PEFT, datasets tooling, ETM/DETM implementation, evaluation + visualization tooling, Streamlit or Gradio for the app

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_ORG>/THETA.git
cd THETA

pip install -r requirements.txt
# or
pip install -e .
````

---

## **Quickstart**
The commands below are templates. Replace module paths/CLI names with your actual implementation.
### **A) Zero-shot Mode**

```
# 1) Data cleaning & semantic enhancement
python -m theta.clean \
  --dataset cfpb \
  --input data/raw/cfpb.csv \
  --output data/processed/cfpb.jsonl

# 2) Generate embeddings (zero-shot)
python -m theta.embed \
  --model Qwen3 \
  --mode zeroshot \
  --input data/processed/cfpb.jsonl \
  --output artifacts/embeddings/cfpb.npy

# 3) Train ETM (or DETM)
python -m theta.topic \
  --method etm \
  --embeddings artifacts/embeddings/cfpb.npy \
  --texts data/processed/cfpb.jsonl \
  --output artifacts/topics/cfpb_etm
```

### **B) LoRA Mode**

```
# 1) Train a domain LoRA adapter (MLM/CLM depending on your setup)
python -m theta.train_lora \
  --base Qwen3 \
  --dataset cfpb \
  --output adapters/adapter_finance

# 2) Generate embeddings with LoRA adapter
python -m theta.embed \
  --model Qwen3 \
  --mode lora \
  --adapter adapters/adapter_finance \
  --input data/processed/cfpb.jsonl \
  --output artifacts/embeddings/cfpb_lora.npy

# 3) Train ETM/DETM
python -m theta.topic \
  --method etm \
  --embeddings artifacts/embeddings/cfpb_lora.npy \
  --texts data/processed/cfpb.jsonl \
  --output artifacts/topics/cfpb_etm_lora
```

## **Data Governance & Preprocessing**
Data governance directly impacts topic coherence and interpretability. THETA uses domain-aware cleaning strategies to preserve semantic signals while removing artifacts that distort topic structure.
Examples of governance strategies:
- Finance/regulatory text (e.g., CFPB)
    - normalize privacy masks (e.g., “XXXX”, “[REDACTED]”) into special tokens      
    - remove template-only submissions without substantive content 
- Social media health or sensitive discourse (e.g., Reddit mental health, hate speech)   
    - avoid deleting emojis and slang; translate emojis into text (e.g., 😭 → “sadness”)     
    - normalize abbreviations when helpful for semantic grouping
     
- Political transcripts
    
    - remove procedural metadata (e.g., “applause”, “chair intervention”) while keeping policy content
        
    
- Honeypot/bot corpora
    
    - strip spam links and tracking tokens, filter extremely low-information posts, optionally tag suspected bot accounts
        
    

  

Governance outputs:

- Standardized corpora (JSONL/CSV), de-identified and format-aligned
    
- Semantically enhanced text copies (emoji-to-text, normalization)
    
- Cleaning report (rules, removed counts, noise categories)

## **Semantic Enhancement (Embeddings)**

  

THETA supports two embedding operation modes:

- Zero-shot: embed texts directly with the base model to establish a baseline
    
- LoRA: load a domain adapter to generate embeddings aligned with domain-specific semantics
    

  

Typical embedding artifacts:

- Embedding matrix (N x D) stored as .npy or .pt
    
- Index mapping from row number to document id
    
- Optional caching for incremental runs
    

  

Recommended adapter naming:

- adapters/adapter_finance
    
- adapters/adapter_mental_health
    
- adapters/adapter_politics
    
- adapters/adapter_hate_speech
    
- adapters/adapter_honeypot
    

---

## **Deep Structure Mining (ETM/DETM)**

  

THETA uses ETM as the primary topic modeling backbone, and DETM for dynamic topic evolution when timestamps are available.

  

Typical outputs:

- Document-topic distribution (theta_d)
    
- Topic descriptors (top keywords and weights per topic)
    
- Topic embeddings for distance maps and hierarchy discovery
    
- Topic evolution timelines (DETM) for trend analysis over time
    

---

## **Validation & Evaluation**

  

THETA treats topic modeling as a validated scientific workflow.

  

Intrinsic evaluation:

- Topic coherence (e.g., C_v)
    
- Perplexity
    
- Optional stability checks across seeds/bootstraps
    

  

Downstream validation examples:

- Finance risk detection: early discovery of illegal collection or hidden-fee themes; trend-based early warning
    
- Suicide ideation detection: topic-derived risk factors improving classifier F1/AUC
    
- Public opinion analysis: decomposing coarse sentiment into fine-grained themes; correlating topic prevalence with external indicators
    
- Bot/script mining: clustering templated narratives and link-heavy spam patterns
    
- Political discourse: tracking topic shifts aligned with events or policy cycles
    

---

## **Agent-Based Platform**

  

THETA can be deployed as an interactive app with three core agents:

- Data Steward: selects cleaning strategies and runs governance scripts
    
- Modeling Analyst: chooses embedding mode, runs ETM/DETM, tunes hyperparameters using metrics
    
- Domain Expert: produces interpretive reports grounded in topics and optional knowledge bases
    

  

Example commands:

```
streamlit run apps/streamlit_app.py
# or
python apps/gradio_app.py
```

---

## **FAQ**

  

Q: Is this only for Qwen-3?

A: No. Qwen-3 is the reference backbone, but THETA is designed to be model-agnostic.

  

Q: What is the difference between ETM and DETM?

A: ETM learns static topics across the corpus; DETM models topic evolution over time and requires timestamps or time bins.

  

Q: Can I add my own dataset?

A: Yes. Export standardized JSONL with at least id and text fields, and implement a dataset adapter.
